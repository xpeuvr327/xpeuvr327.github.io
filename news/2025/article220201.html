        <h1>linux commands you may offen found</h1>
        <h2>preamble</h2>
<p>so i was tweaking with some old phones with android. i downloaded some terminal emulators, and was surprised that some commands even worked. remember, we're talking about commands, not programs (foreshadowing). also, some of these work even on the wii, which is cool
</p>
<p>
<ul>
ls 
cd 
cat 
echo 
clear 
export 
ping 
whoami chown chmod pwd grep curl
</ul>
these were some of the commands that you can run on a linux machine. maybe are they in the linux kernel
